# Potato Disease Classification
## INTRODUCTION
This project demonstrates a Deep learning model that classify diiseases in potatoes plant using CNN Model.It uses the dataset from kaggle . It also contains a website for interaction with the machine learning model.

### Below data science concepts are used in this project

  - Data loading in batches using tensorflow (keras.preprocessing)

  - Split dataset in train test
  
  - Build CNN model
  
  - compile model
  
  - train data

### Technology and tools used in this project

   - Python
   
   - tensorflow keras for model building
   
   - Matplotlib for data visualization
   
   - Jupyter Notebook
   
   - Python flask for http server
   
   - HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
## Step
 1.We will first build a model using keras and CNN
 
 2.Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests.
 
 3.Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to choose file for classify the disease
    
    Step#1: Import the required libraries
    Step#2: Load the data
    Step#3: Understand the data
    Step#4: split data in train test dataset for traing and testing
    Step#5: Build Deep Learning Model
    Step#6: Testing The model
    Step#7: Export the model
    Step#8: Export any other important info
